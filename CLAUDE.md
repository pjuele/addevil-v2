# Project Kickstart Guide

## Project Metadata
**Instructions for User:** Fill in these fields when starting a new project. Leave blank fields if uncertain - Claude will ask follow-up questions.

**Project Name:** ADDevil - ADHD-Friendly Todo System  
**Primary Goal:** Design and prototype a todo system specifically for people with ADHD (inattentive type focus)  
**Key Challenge/Problem:** Traditional todo systems overwhelm ADHD brains - need system that works with ADHD patterns, not against them  
**Success Looks Like:** Working data model + basic visualization that demonstrates ADHD-specific features like Three-List System, overwhelm prevention  
**Timeline/Urgency:** Brainstorming/prototyping phase - no rush, focus on getting the concepts right  
**Estimated Complexity:** Medium - start simple with data model, expand to visualization/prototype 

**Instructions for Claude:** 
- Read this metadata section FIRST when starting any new project session
- If fields are complete, use this context to frame all conversations
- If fields are incomplete or blank, run a "project setup interview" with create-next-app style questions to gather missing information
- Reference this metadata throughout the project to maintain focus on stated goals

## Purpose
This file contains instructions for Claude on how to approach life project folders. Copy this to new project folders as `CLAUDE.md` to establish consistent working methodology.

## Project Philosophy
- **Action-oriented**: The ultimate goal is enabling real-world action, not endless planning
- **Iterative**: Build knowledge and insights over time through repeated conversations
- **Structured**: Use CLAUDE.md as persistent knowledge storage across sessions
- **Artifact-driven**: Create supporting tools/documents only when they genuinely help move thinking forward

## Working Approach
1. **Maintain Context**: Always update CLAUDE.md with key insights, decisions, and next steps
2. **Build on Previous Work**: Start each session by referencing what we've established before
3. **Focus on Unlocking**: Help identify and work through stuck points and hang-ups
4. **Balance Thinking and Action**: Connect abstract insights to concrete next steps
5. **Leverage Strengths**: Use my natural abilities while addressing limitations

## File Structure for Projects
- `CLAUDE.md`: Session notes, insights, decisions, next actions (project-specific)
- `Me.md`: Personal profile for context (shared file - see instructions below)
- Additional artifacts as needed: lists, templates, tools, analysis documents

## Personal Context Setup
**Important:** Do NOT copy Me.md to project folders. Instead, use the shared version:
- **Shared Me.md location:** `/Users/pjuele/Documents/Life/Me/Me.md`
- **Claude instruction:** Read the shared Me.md file from the above absolute path at the start of each session
- **If file not found:** Immediately notify the user that the Me.md file cannot be accessed at the expected location - do NOT proceed silently. Ask user to verify the file path or provide alternative location.

## Claude's Role
- Help structure thinking and identify patterns
- Provide outside perspective on blind spots
- Suggest frameworks and approaches
- Keep conversations focused on the project's ultimate real-world goals
- Generate artifacts only when they serve the larger purpose

## CRITICAL: Design & Styling Standards
**ALWAYS** refer to `/Users/pjuele/Documents/Life/styles/style-guidelines.md` for ALL UI/design work.

Key requirements:
- **Shadcn UI aesthetic** - minimal, professional, clean
- **Exact color palette**: #09090b (page), #181818 (panels), #252525 (elements), #404040 (hover)
- **Single text color**: #E5E5E5 throughout
- **Accent colors ONLY for borders** - never backgrounds
- **No rainbow interfaces** - stick to neutral grays with subtle accents

This is non-negotiable for maintaining consistency across all life projects.

## Session Flow
1. **Read shared Me.md** from `/Users/pjuele/Documents/Life/Me/Me.md` for personal context
2. **Read project metadata** at top of this file for project-specific context
3. Review previous CLAUDE.md to understand where we left off
4. Explore current challenges or questions
5. Develop insights and potential approaches
6. Identify concrete next steps
7. Update CLAUDE.md with key outcomes

## Session Notes & Progress

### Session 1 - Initial Brainstorming (Aug 23, 2025)

**Key ADHD Todo System Requirements Identified:**

From ADDitude Magazine research:
- **Three-List System**: Long List (everything), Routine List (timed/situational), Short List (daily focus)
- **Single-Item Focus**: Best solution is limiting to one item to prevent overwhelm
- **Priority Categories**: "Now," "Later," "Parking Lot" approach
- **Time Awareness**: ADHD brains overestimate available time - need realistic time booking
- **Master List Management**: Turn stagnant lists into daily action plans

**Completed Features:**
1. ‚úÖ Design data model incorporating Three-List System
2. ‚úÖ Add time estimation/booking features
3. ‚úÖ Include overwhelm prevention mechanisms  
4. ‚úÖ Consider routine/habit integration
5. ‚úÖ Create visual wireframes with proper Shadcn UI styling
6. ‚úÖ Build interactive prototype with drag-and-drop functionality
7. ‚úÖ Implement responsive design for mobile/tablet
8. ‚úÖ Add completion animations and visual feedback
9. ‚úÖ Create reusable animation system
10. ‚úÖ Build JSON-based project management with priority visualization
11. ‚úÖ Fix UX bugs (blue frame persistence, focus limit feedback, rejected task feedback)
12. ‚úÖ Add ADHD-friendly completion sound effects with Web Audio API

**Design System Established:**
- Implemented Shadcn UI color palette and design principles
- Created shared style guidelines at `/Users/pjuele/Documents/Life/styles/style-guidelines.md`

**Current Project Status:**
- **prototype.html**: Fully functional ADHD-friendly todo system with Three-List System, drag-and-drop, focus mode, mobile responsiveness, completion animations, and Web Audio API sound effects
- **todos.html**: Project management visualization with active/completed task columns, priority-based sorting, and grayed-out completed tasks
- **todo.json**: 23 tracked project todos with metadata and status tracking (multiple tasks completed this session)
- **Style system**: Comprehensive guidelines and animation library for consistent design
